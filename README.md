Simple Counter - a JavaScript Project by Tarek


This project is a simple counter built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The counter counts upwards, starting from 0. The numbers' colors change based on their value. If the number is positive, it turns green. If it is negative, it turns red. If it is zero, it turns black.


The project does not use any third-party libraries or frameworks, just plain old JavaScript and a little CSS. It's a great exercise for learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and it's a fun and simple project to build.
